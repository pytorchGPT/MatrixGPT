# MatrixGPT
This repository contains example PyTorch code that demonstrates how to build and train a small text-generation model. The implementation includes the following components:

Multi-head attention

Sample PositionalEncoding

Mixture of Experts (MoE) example

Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)

GQA attention (illustrative / simplified)

Tokenizer and data preprocessing

Top-k sampling for text generation
top-p text generation 
sample next word text generation

The goal is to provide runnable, well-documented code that can be trained on free platforms (Kaggle/Colab) when using smaller model sizes or efficient training techniques. I’d like someone to train the model and upload the final model weights (.pth) to this repository so I can test and study the results.
